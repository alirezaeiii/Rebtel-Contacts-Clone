# Rebtel-Contacts-Clone
A sample to showcase a customized contact list divided into sections with group header. In the Rebtel app contacts with single or multiple numbers displayed in a fixed list separated by line breaker without any detail screen which needed to parse contact provider items in a background thread using RxJava. This sample used [getItemViewType](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter#getItemViewType(int)) in order to create RecyclerView with multiple view types. Contact items are separated by sticky header unlike Rebtel. It includes a custom CoordinatorLayout.Behavior in order to hide/show appBar and bottomBar according to user's scroll. For Dialpad instead of using ConstraintLayout, I built a custom ViewGroup that lays out child views with equal distance which doesn't go through the general-purpose layout engine like ConstraintLayout, that has much more overhead to support complex constraints.

## Features
* MVVM Architecture + Repository design Pattern.
* Jetpack Libraries and Architecture Components.

## Libraries
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
   * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
   * [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) is a Library in the support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
   * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components updating app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
* [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for Java, Kotlin, and Android.
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) is a library for composing asynchronous code using observable sequences.
* [libphonenumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber) Google library for parsing, formatting, and validating international phone numbers.
* [Dialpad-CustomView](https://github.com/Ali-Rezaei/CharityLayout) is a Custom ViewGroup that lays out child views with equal distance.
